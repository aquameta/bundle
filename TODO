track_relation_rows() should say how many were tracked, a nice summary would be nice
stage_tracked_rows() should show count - https://stackoverflow.com/a/4047976/368635
create views for everything, even if we don't use them internally
audit pg_catalog and delta need to be ignored?
tracked_rows() function takes id but has pub-style sig
tracked_rows(repo_id)?  why repo_id, or is it optional?
move delta_test schema to test_count schema
set-counts not picking up tracked_rows_added -- create it
track_relation_rows() ^^
make count-diff repo-agnistic?
stage_rows() -> repository_stage_rows()
^^ repeat for anythign that takes a repo_id ? - commit_fields()
create repo_commit_fields(uuid default null) pulls from head commit by default
offstage_row_deleted() -> offstage_rows_deleted()
create stage_rows_deleted()
rename basically all functions to use {op}_ nomenclature, where {op} = { get | set | stage | track | add | remove | ... }
finish commit, to support deletes and changed fields
